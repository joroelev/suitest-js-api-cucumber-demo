# Suitest JavaScript API demo - Cucumber integration

This repository contains a demo of [Suitest JS API](https://github.com/SuitestAutomation/suitest-js-api) e2e tests with [Cucumber test runner](https://cucumber.io/).

## Setup

1. Copy `.suitestrc.dist` file as `.suitestrc` and fill in it's contents with your values according to [documentation](https://suite.st/docs/suitest-api/setup/#environment-setup). .suitestrc.base.json, .suitestrc.json, .suitestrc.parallel.json - are example of defining configuration files for running single or several devices.

2. In terminal run `npm ci`.

3. Run `npm run start` for run tests on single device or `npm run parallel` for run tests for several devices.

## Example tests

You can find some Suitest tests written for WatchMe app (every Suitest account has this app by default). Those tests rely on some elements from Suitest "Element repository" and configuration where base url set to https://watchme.suite.st/hbbtv.html - HbbTv configuration in WatchMe app. So make sure you properly adjusted .suitestrc file.
